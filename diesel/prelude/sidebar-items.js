If there was already a select clause, it will be overridden. The expression passed to `select` must actually be valid for the query (only contains columns from the target table, doesn't mix aggregate + non-aggregate expressions, etc)."],["WithDsl","Adds an additional expression to the FROM clause. This is useful for things like full text search, where you need to access the result of an expensive computation for the where clause that shouldn't be redone for each row, such as `plain_to_tsquery`. See `.aliased` for more"]]});
